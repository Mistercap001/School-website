    <p>The infrastructure is important for faster economic growth and alleviation of poverty in the country. The adequate infrastructure in the form of road and railway transport system, ports, power, airports and their efficient working is also needed for integration of the Indian economy with other economies of the world.</p>
    <p>A  distinguishing feature of infrastructure is that while the demand-supply gap in case of other factors can be met by importing some of them, the deficiency of infrastructure cannot be made up through imports. Because location-based the need for relevant infrastructure facility can be met through development of its capacity in the domestic economy. For example, you cannot import power facility, roads, ports or railways as they have to be built up in the domestic economy.</p>
